8. Disable screenshot drop shadows ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool TRUE')

9. Enable screenshot drop shadows ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool FALSE')

10. Change screenshot file format to PDF ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture type PDF')

11. Change screenshot file format to PNG ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture type png')

12. Change screenshot file format to JPG ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg')

13. Show hidden files and folders ('defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE')

14. Hide hidden files and folders ('defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool FALSE')

15. Stress test this computer ('yes')

16. Check the uptime of this Mac ('uptime')

17. Check for software updates ('sudo softwareupdate -l')

18. Update software, if new software is available ('sudo softwareupdate -ia')

19. Run the last non-sudo command again ('!!')

20. Run the last sudo command again ('sudo !!')

21. Shut down this Mac immediately ('sudo shutdown -h now')

22. Restart this Mac immediately ('sudo shutdown -r now')

25. Restart this Mac with a time delay in hours ('sudo shutdown -r +$RTIMEM')

26. Get network IP address ('ipconfig getifaddr en1')

27. Get external IP address ('curl ipecho.net/plain; echo')

Version 2.0

This is the first major update made to the structure of the script. This update features loops, nested if-statements, and same-line text entry. Also, the variable structure was vastly simplified from over 30 variables to just 4. Additionally, the commands list has been consolidated into a list of 8 categorized options, instead of listing out every individual command on the opening page. The following commands are featured in this update:

1. killall Finder ('killall Finder')

2. killall Dock ('killall Dock')

3. killall SystemUIServer ('killall SystemUIServer')

4. Prevent display from sleeping ('caffeinate -d')

5. Prevent system from idle sleep ('caffeinate -i')

6. Prevent system from sleeping (only works on AC power) ('caffeinate -s')

7. Declare that the system user is active ('caffeinate -u')

8. Specify a the duration of time to timeout ('caffeinate -t $CAFFTIME')

9. Disable screenshot drop shadows ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool TRUE')

10. Enable screenshot drop shadows ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool FALSE')

11. Change screenshot file format to PDF ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture type PDF')

12. Change screenshot file format to PNG ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture type png')

13. Change screenshot file format to JPG ('defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg')

14. Show hidden files and folders ('defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE')

15. Hide hidden files and folders ('defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool FALSE')

16. Stress test this computer ('yes')

17. Check the uptime of this Mac ('uptime')

18. Check for software updates ('sudo softwareupdate -l')

19. Update software, if new software is available ('sudo softwareupdate -ia')

20. Get network IP address ('ipconfig getifaddr en1')

21. Get external IP address ('curl ipecho.net/plain; echo')

22. Test network connectivity to apple.com ('ping -c 10 www.apple.com')


Version 2.1

This update features several small improvements and bug fixes on major version 2.0. The following changes were made:

1. Line 170 in version 2.0: The echo statement was incorrect, changed "PNG" to "JPG"

2. $CHOICE = 5 > $SECONDCHOICE = 1 (Lines 219-231 in version 2.0): There were several problems with this stress test command. The following changes were made to this portion of code:
	
	1. Replaced the 'yes' command with 'yes > /dev/null & yes > /dev/null &'. Both of these commands do roughly the same thing (they both max out a single core of the computer's CPU), but the new command is generally more accepted and more versatile.

	2. Added a y/n question asking the user if they are sure they would like to stress test their computer. The inclusion of this new code also calls a new variable: $STRESSCHOICE

	3. Included a portion of code that asks the user how long they would like to stress test the computer for. The inclusion of this new code also calls a new variable: $STRESSSECONDS

	4. Removed the following echo statement: "echo "Utilizing 100% of the CPU"". Replaced this statement with "echo "Stress testing single CPU core..."".

	5. Added a 'sleep $STRESSSECONDS' command to have the Terminal wait (test) for the user-specified amount of time.

	6. Added the 'killall yes' command after the main stress test command has been executed for the user-specified amount of time. This command ends the 'yes' process.

	7. Removed the echo statement: "echo "Press Control + C to cancel."" as this is not accurate.

3. Various blank echo statements were added to the script for proper/consistent spacing between lines.

4. Removed the 'killall Terminal' command at the end of the script due to a misunderstanding as to what it actually does. The desired outcome was to close the current Terminal window ONLY, but I have been informed that this closes all Terminal windows.


Version 2.2

This update features several changes to the stress test commands, including the addition of two new commands. Here is a complete changelog for this version:

1. Added two new stress test commands for dual-core processors and quad-core processors ($CHOICE = 5 > $SECONDCHOICE = 2,3).

2. Updated the verbiage of the command listed under $CHOICE = 5 > $SECONDCHOICE = 1 (stress test single core).

3. For all three stress test commands, the user now has the option to open the Activity Monitor application prior to performing the test.
